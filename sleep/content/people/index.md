#### Professor Guy Brown

Guy is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield. His main research interest is machine hearing, which aims to build AI systems that mimic the ability of human listeners to segregate complex mixtures of sound. His recent work has focused on applications of machine hearing to the screening and diagnosis of sleep and respiratory disorders, with a particular emphasis on obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).

Guy is currently the interim director of Sheffield's [Centre for Machine Intelligence](http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ai). He has published widely in journals and conferences and is the co-editor of the book Computational Auditory Scene Analysis: Principles, Algorithms and Applications (with Prof Deliang Wang, published by IEEE Press). 

#### Dr Ning Ma

Ning is a Lecturer in Medical Computing at the Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield, and also a member of the Academic Directorate of Medical Imaging and Medical Physics at the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Ningâ€™s research interests lie in speech and hearing technologies, machine learning and healthcare. In particular, his research interests focus on development of AI systems that can interpret sounds and low-cost sensor data and extract useful information for screening health issues, such as sleep-disordered breathing and respiratory diseases. He has been PI and Co-PI of several UKRI and HEIF grants on acoustic monitoring of sleep-disordered breathing and cough sound analysis for tuberculosis screening. He is also interested in music AI technology and its link with mental health.

Ning has published 60+ refereed journals and conference papers. He is the Lead Area Chair for INTERSPEECH 2023 and 2024, for the area of Speech, Voice, and Hearing Disorders. He regularly reviews manuscripts and grants for a range of journals and funders.

Ning is a [Insigneo Institute](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/insigneo) Research Theme Co-Director for Healthcare data/AI. He is a member of the British Sleep Society, the British Thoracic Society and IEEE.

#### Xiaolei Xu

Since September 2023, Xialoei has been a PhD student in the Pervasive Computing Group in the Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield. Previously, he was a Masters student at Sheffield majoring in Advanced Computer Science. During his MSc he was also a research intern working on the classification of environmental sounds in the Machine Intelligence for Natural Interfaces (MINI) Group. 

At present, Xiaolei's research is centred around the application of mobile sensing techniques, leveraging microphones and other cheap sensors (such as accelerometers) to monitor and diagnose sleep disorders. His work has a particular emphasis on sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnoea. He has particular interest in signal processing and machine learning methodologies, and the use of these to optimise the diagnostic capabilities of machine listening systems.
