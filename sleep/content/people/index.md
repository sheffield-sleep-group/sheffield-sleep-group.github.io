#### Guy Brown
Professor of Computer Science

My main research interest is Computational Auditory Scene Analysis (CASA), which aims to build machine systems that mimic the ability of human listeners to segregate complex mixtures of sound. I also have interests in reverberation-robust automatic speech recognition, hearing impairment and music technology.
